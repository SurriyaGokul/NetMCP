# sysctl - TCP Low Latency
- id: sysctl.tcp_low_latency
  category: sysctl
  subcategory: tcp_low_latency

  name: "TCP Low Latency"
  description: "Prioritize latency over throughput"

  purpose: |
    Configures TCP to prioritize low latency over maximum throughput by
    reducing buffering and processing delays. Essential for gaming and
    real-time applications where latency is more critical than raw bandwidth.

  use_cases:
    primary:
      - name: "Gaming"
        reason: "Minimize processing delay"
        priority: "high"
      - name: "Real-time Applications"
        reason: "Reduce TCP processing latency"
        priority: "high"

    secondary:
      - name: "Interactive SSH"
        reason: "Responsive remote terminal sessions"
        priority: "medium"

  impact:
    latency: "↓↓" # High latency reduction
    throughput: "↓" # Some throughput sacrifice
    jitter: "↓" # Reduced processing variation
    cpu_usage: "↑" # More frequent processing
    security: "~" # Neutral

  configuration:
    command_template: "echo '{enable}' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_low_latency"

    examples:
      - description: "Enable low latency mode for gaming"
        command: "echo '1' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_low_latency"
        params:
          enable: "1"

  parameters:
    - name: "enable"
      type: "integer"
      description: "Enable (1) or disable (0) low latency mode"
      default: "1"
      valid_values: ["0", "1"]

  when_to_use:
    network_conditions:
      - "Gaming environments"
      - "Real-time applications"
      - "Interactive services"

      - "Small, frequent packets"
      - "Real-time gaming traffic"

  monitoring:
    - name: "latency_measurement"
      method: "ping or application-specific latency tests"
      expected: "Reduced latency for TCP connections"

  complexity_level: "High"
  risk_level: "High - Direct latency reduction"

  anti_patterns:
    - pattern: "Using for bulk transfer applications"
      why: "Sacrifices throughput unnecessarily"
      fix: "Use only for latency-sensitive applications"
