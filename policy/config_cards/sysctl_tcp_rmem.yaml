  name: "TCP Receive Memory Buffer"
  description: "Configure TCP socket receive buffer sizes"

  purpose: |
    Controls the TCP receive buffer sizes for all TCP sockets on the system.
    Affects how much data can be buffered for incoming TCP connections,
    directly impacting throughput and memory usage for high-bandwidth or
    high-latency network connections.

  use_cases:
    primary:
      - name: "High-Bandwidth Networks"
        reason: "Optimize throughput for fast network connections"
        priority: "high"
      - name: "High-Latency Networks"
        reason: "Buffer more data to maintain throughput over long distances"
        priority: "high"

    secondary:
      - name: "Server Optimization"
        reason: "Tune for many concurrent connections"
        priority: "medium"
      - name: "Application Performance"
        reason: "Reduce application blocking on network I/O"
        priority: "medium"

  impact:
    throughput: "↑↑" # Higher buffers enable better throughput
    latency: "~" # Minimal impact on latency
    memory_usage: "↑↑" # Increases per-connection memory usage
    connection_scalability: "↓" # Fewer connections possible with larger buffers
    cpu_usage: "↑" # More memory copying overhead

  anti_patterns:
    - pattern: "Setting max buffer too high without sufficient RAM"
      why: "Can lead to memory exhaustion under load"
      fix: "Calculate max_connections × max_buffer_size < available_memory"

    - pattern: "Setting min buffer too low"
      why: "Can cause poor performance for all connections"
      fix: "Ensure min buffer is at least 4KB, preferably 8KB+"

    - pattern: "Ignoring application buffer sizes"
      why: "Application buffers may limit effectiveness"
      fix: "Coordinate with application-level buffer tuning"

    - pattern: "Not considering connection count"
      why: "High buffer × many connections = memory exhaustion"
      fix: "Balance buffer sizes with expected connection concurrency"
