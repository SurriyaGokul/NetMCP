# Validation Limits for Network Parameter Plans
# Defines constraints for validator to check against
# Configurable limits for bandwidth, DSCP, and other validation checks

validation_limits:
  # Bandwidth/Shaper Limits (in Mbps)
  # Source: Modern datacenter hardware capabilities (100GbE, 200GbE, 400GbE)
  bandwidth:
    # Maximum allowed bandwidth values (in Mbps)
    # Adjust based on your infrastructure:
    #   - Datacenter/Cloud: 100000-400000 (100-400 Gbps)
    #   - Enterprise: 10000-40000 (10-40 Gbps)
    #   - SMB/Branch: 1000-10000 (1-10 Gbps)
    #   - IoT/Edge: 100-1000 (100 Mbps - 1 Gbps)
    max_mbps: 100000  # 100 Gbps - reasonable upper bound for modern hardware
    
    # Minimum bandwidth (prevent misconfigurations)
    min_mbps: 1  # 1 Mbps minimum
    
    # Validation rules
    rules:
      - "ceil_mbit must be >= egress_mbit (HTB requirement)"
      - "ingress_mbit must be within [min_mbps, max_mbps]"
      - "egress_mbit must be within [min_mbps, max_mbps]"
      - "ceil_mbit must be within [min_mbps, max_mbps]"
    
    notes:
      - "100 Gbps accommodates modern datacenter NICs"
      - "Acts as sanity check to catch typos (e.g., 999999)"
      - "Modify max_mbps based on your deployment context"

  # DSCP (DiffServ Code Point) Valid Values
  # Source: RFC 2474, RFC 4594 (Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes)
  dscp:
    # Standard DSCP values commonly supported by network equipment
    valid_values:
      - "EF"    # Expedited Forwarding (RFC 3246) - Voice, critical real-time
      - "CS6"   # Class Selector 6 - Network control
      - "CS5"   # Class Selector 5 - Signaling
      - "CS4"   # Class Selector 4 - Streaming video
      - "AF41"  # Assured Forwarding 41 (RFC 2597) - High priority data
      - "AF42"  # Assured Forwarding 42 - High priority data
      - "AF43"  # Assured Forwarding 43 - High priority data
    
    descriptions:
      EF: "Expedited Forwarding - Lowest latency, highest priority (VoIP, gaming)"
      CS6: "Class Selector 6 - Network routing protocols"
      CS5: "Class Selector 5 - Video conferencing, broadcast video"
      CS4: "Class Selector 4 - Streaming video, bulk data"
      AF41: "Assured Forwarding 4/1 - High priority data, low drop"
      AF42: "Assured Forwarding 4/2 - High priority data, medium drop"
      AF43: "Assured Forwarding 4/3 - High priority data, high drop"
    
    rules:
      - "DSCP values must be RFC-standardized"
      - "Network equipment must support the DSCP value"
      - "EF should be reserved for latency-critical traffic only"
    
    notes:
      - "Other DSCP values (AF11-AF33, CS0-CS3) can be added if needed"
      - "Default (best effort) traffic uses DSCP 0 (not configured explicitly)"
      - "DSCP remarking may occur at network boundaries"
